				<p>As we can see the pandemic is affecting all sorts of businesses and the events business is suffering a lot.</p>
				<p>Radiohead’s frontman Thom Yorke announced last night that the <b>UK tour 2020 has been cancelled due to pandemic.</b></p><p><span><i>"Unfortunately the tour is not happening as the events are not allowed. It has been postponed to the next year so hopefully our fans will be able to see us then."</i></span></p>
				<p>Meanwhile Radiohead release every few weeks footage from one of their older concerts on <a href="#">Youtube</a>. Fans can at least enjoy the live shows from their homes if nothing else. </p>
				<p>This became quite popular between many artists. They now share on social media or Youtube their shows or acoustic performances from their homes. This allows us to see a new side to our favourite artists, which we would not see in a world without Covid-19. I guess there is a positive side to everything. But let’s hope we can come back to going to live shows safely very soon.</p>
